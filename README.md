# Mmw_Project
This is my first ever semi large scale project where I am doing our group's landing page and website. The purpose of this project is for school requirements and practical application of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This is the first update since I've only uploaded this today. The files that you can see within this repository are the codes I have programmed for our product's landing page and front-end web page (no backend for now which is sad). This will also serve as a project that can back up my knowedge and application of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. So far, I have added buttons that have animations, two of them lead to other social media sites for promotion. the other two will be features within the landing page itself, however, I will do those tomorrow lol. 
I have also added various custom sized images by the designing department of our group as our icons that will be ineractable in the site. I have also fixed the navigations bar position because I want the users to see the navbar since within it, comes the "back-top-top" button which brings them to the top of the page when they need to without scrollng all the way up.
That is mostly all what I did for now, I will further update this tomorrow.
