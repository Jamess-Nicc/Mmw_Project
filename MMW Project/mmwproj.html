<!--make this a navigation bar but keep the inline block style display. It will serve
as a navigation bar. The display should be fixed so even though the user scrolls, the navbar
is still appearing with the scrolling. add customized logos on the buttons above. The buttons should preferrably
have no border around them. It should be a standalone image that has the properties of a button 
such as hover and icons should lead to other links like fb, ig, our website etc.-->
